        Webmonitor is a Java application for monitoring state of web services. It will periodically check and log a state of configured websites. Optionally it can be configured to send email or Discord webhook notifications.

    <h1>Functionality</h1>
    <strong>Initialization</strong>
    <p>
        {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.Main} is the entry class of the program.
        This class is responsible for processing command line arguments and calling appropriate parts of the program to load configuration and start monitoring processes.
        Arguments are processed in {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.Arguments} class.
        Logging and other functions are enabled based on arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Configuration file in YAML format is loaded and processed by {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.config.ConfigLoader} class into
        {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.config.GlobalConfig} and {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.config.ServiceConfig} objects.
        The class is also responsible for detecting errors in configuration supplemented by user.
    </p>
    <p>
        All messages are separated from the code in <code>resources/messages.properties</code> file and loaded in {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.Messages} class.
        This would potentially allow for easy translation into multiple languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the configuration is loaded the program creates pool of threads for each monitored service and the configuration is passed to them.
        A task is represented by {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.monitoring.MonitorTask} object which implements Runnable interface.
    </p>

    <strong>Monitoring</strong>
    <p>
        Each task executes the following series of actions in a specified interval.
        First {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.monitoring.Requester#request Requester.request} method is called to send a HTTP request.
        The function wraps the resulting request (or exception) into a {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.monitoring.ResponseData} object.
        This object is further passed into {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.monitoring.ResponseAnalyzer#analyze ResponseAnalyzer.analyze} method which analyzes the response
        and triggers corresponding action based on the configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        If configured, {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.notifications.DiscordNotifier} or {@link cz.cuni.mff.webmonitor.notifications.EmailNotifier} are used to send a warning.

    <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
    <p>
        Email notifier was initially planned to use some well-known service like Gmail.
        However, it proved challenging to implement sending emails using Gmail. Connecting to Gmail's SMTP servers wasn't working.
        MailJet service appeared to be reliable after initial testing. While it is working solution, it's not ideal as setup is complicated and email get classified as spam.
    </p>
    <p>
        YAML is a great format for configuration files. But it doesn't work ideally with Java. As it is statically typed language lot of casting and error checking is required when parsing the file.
